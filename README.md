VirtKick is a simple, open source orchestrator.
Managing virtual machines or Docker containers has never been easier.

That's the VirtKick Starter. It will allow you to start using VirtKick with a single click.

This is a heavy work in progress and not yet one-click install. Don't judge - it will be improved! Please [report an issue](https://github.com/virtkick/virtkick) if you face any problems. We need your help to make it bullet-proof. Thanks! :-)

## Distro specific prerequisites

### Ubuntu 14.04

Most things are already handled by `virtkick-start`, you only need Git.
```
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Other

Over time we plan to add streamlined installation for other distros as well. General rule of thumb is to have a development environment (make, g++), libvirt and qemu. `virtkick-starter` will try to setup rest by itself.

## First run

1. `git clone https://github.com/virtkick/virtkick-starter.git`
2. `cd virtkick-starter`
3. `./virtkick-start -dim`

First start may take a couple of minutes due to download of various dependencies. It will ask for root password to setup things in `setup/system.sh`, as you may inspect. During run it will also download iso images to `/home/virtkick/iso`, make sure you have enough disk space left (~25 GB).

After everything is set up, open up  [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and try out virtkick by creating a virtual machine or two. :) Happy hacking!

## Next runs

1. `./virtkick-start -dm`

## Upgrading

1. `git pull`
2. `./virtkick-start -dim`

## Hacker Zoneâ„¢

See `./virtkick-start -h` for other options.

Some environment variables may be set to customize:

- `PORT` - reverse proxy listen port (defaults to 3000)
- `RAILS_PORT` - Rails web application listen port (defaults to 60000)
- `WORKER_COUNT` - number of background jobs workers (defaults to 2)
- `NO_DOWNLOAD` - skip download of iso files to `/home/virtkick/iso`
